# Medical-Service-Provider-System
The "Medical Service Provider System" is a scaled-down software solution designed to efficiently manage and deliver medical services to patients. The system aims to optimize the delivery of medical services to patients by doctors while ensuring effective financial management.
The system consists of five essential modules: Users, Patients, Doctors, Services, and Transactions. Administrators act as intermediaries between doctors and patients, facilitating the delivery of services by doctors to patients. Transactions are carefully tracked and recorded for each service provided. 
The project incorporates a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java Struts2, and MySQL, to ensure a robust and efficient application.
